Go

I have written the following Go code through trial & error and 'Googling'.

* Update Dockerfile with hard-coded IP address, so that VirtualBox etc can reach test endpoint on your machine.

* Build out an image ./build_docker.sh
* Run the example ./run_docker.sh <num_requests> <url>
 * If you do not pass a URL raspberrypi.org will be used by default.
